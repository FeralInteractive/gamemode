/**
 * Simple daemon to allow user space programs to control the CPU governors
 *
 * The main process is responsible for bootstrapping the D-BUS daemon, caching
 * the initial governor settings, and then responding to requests over D-BUS.
 *
 * Clients register their pid(s) with the service, which are routinely checked
 * to see if they've expired. Once we reach our first actively registered client
 * we put the system into "game mode", i.e. move the CPU governor into a performance
 * mode.
 *
 * Upon exit, or when all clients have stopped running, we put the system back
 * into the default governor policy, which is invariably powersave or similar
 * on laptops. This ensures that the system is obtaining the maximum performance
 * whilst gaming, and allowed to sanely return to idle once the workload is
 * complete.
